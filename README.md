# Smart_medical_image_annotator
This project simulates tumor detection using a simple UNet model with the MNIST dataset. Digits 0 and 1 represent "no tumor" and "tumor" respectively. The model processes each image, outputs a mask, and displays both the input and result while printing if a tumor is detected. It's a basic demo for learning image segmentation.
